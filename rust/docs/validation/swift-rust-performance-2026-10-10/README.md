# Swift vs Rust performance on the same Mac — 2026-10-10

First same-machine comparison of the shipped Swift apps against Rust release
builds. Method, isolation and metric definitions: [METHOD.md](METHOD.md).
Raw trials: `launch/raw/`, `microbench/r*/`, `idle/`. Harness sources: `harness/`.

## Results

### Launch, idle CPU and memory (end-to-end, external measurement)

Interleaved trials; warm n=8, cold n=5 (`sudo purge` before each); p50 [min–max].

| App | Launch | First window (ms) | Visually settled (ms) | Idle CPU (% of one core) | Physical footprint (MB) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Swift Agent 0.1.122 | warm | 211 [197–222] | 307 [293–331] | 0.01 [0.01–0.02] | 25.1 [24.3–25.8] |
| Rust Agent `973e7bed` | warm | 154 [134–160] | 154 [134–160] | 0.46 [0.45–0.47] | 78.4 [74.6–78.8] |
| Swift Box 0.0.77 | warm | 570 [558–594] | 570 [558–594] | 0.02 [0.02–0.03] | 28.9 [28.5–29.7] |
| Rust Box `1ecbaa3d` | warm | 169 [162–177] | 169 [162–177] | 0.48 [0.47–0.52] | 124.3 [120.2–125.2] |
| Rust Box, same sandbox as Swift Box (control) | warm | 174 [162–199] | 174 [162–199] | 0.49 [0.48–0.53] | 124.3 [107.8–124.8] |
| Swift Agent | cold | 966 [821–1066] | 1344 [1124–1388] | 0.02 | 24.0 |
| Rust Agent | cold | 687 [521–725] | 687 [521–725] | 0.47 | 78.4 |
| Swift Box | cold | 1526 [1473–1574] | 1526 [1473–1574] | 0.02 | 28.6 |
| Rust Box | cold | 728 [652–842] | 851 [729–945] | 0.50 | 120.4 |

Interpretation:

- Rust shows a complete first window sooner. Swift Box's figure includes a
  deliberate 300 ms `asyncAfter` before it opens its main window
  (`BelloBoxApp.swift`), so the framework difference for Box is smaller than the
  table suggests. The sandbox control shows the Keychain-denial profile itself
  costs ~5 ms.
- Rust uses **25–50× more idle CPU** (0.46–0.50% vs 0.01–0.02% of one core) and
  **3–4× more memory** as Activity Monitor reports it. RSS points the other way
  (Swift 67–78 MB vs Rust 52–54 MB) because RSS counts shared system-framework
  pages; footprint is the user-visible figure.
- Idle diagnosis (`idle/`): with `BELLO_PERF_LOG` the Rust apps performed **zero**
  render callbacks during 10 s of idle, yet `top` shows ~63 wakeups/s — GPUI
  0.2.2 keeps a `CVDisplayLink` running for every visible window and calls its
  frame callback at the display rate (60 Hz here) even when nothing is dirty.
  Footprint breakdown: Rust Agent 33 MB IOSurface (window drawables) + 8 MB
  Metal; Rust Box 70 MB Metal (IOAccelerator) + 36 MB IOSurface. These are
  framework/renderer costs, not app logic.

### Box engine microbenchmark (in-process, not end-to-end UI)

Shipped Swift sources from `e43b1c4` (`DeveloperJSON.swift`, `TextTransforms.swift`
lines 281–332) compiled with `swiftc -O -wmo` vs rust-branch `bellobox-core`
(release, thin LTO). Same inputs; 3 interleaved process rounds × 30 samples.

| Operation | Input | Swift p50 ms | Rust p50 ms | Outputs |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| JSON pretty | 296 KB, 19,801 values | 50.8 [46.1–59.3] | 6.8 [5.8–7.7] | byte-identical |
| JSON minify | same | 47.0 [43.5–53.7] | 5.4 [5.0–6.5] | byte-identical |
| Lines: remove duplicates | 490 KB, 15,791 lines | 25.2 [22.4–28.9] | 9.7 [8.8–11.3] | byte-identical |
| Text counts | same | 68.0 [63.3–76.1] | 10.3 [9.8–12.6] | identical |
| Lines: sort A→Z | same | 220.3 [202.9–238.3] | 2.8 [2.4–3.4] | **different** (see below) |

Parity defects found by this run (both reproducible from `harness/`):

1. **JSON value limit.** A 486 KB document with 32,347 values (depth 4) formats
   in Swift (~83 ms) but Rust rejects it: `JSON exceeds 64 levels or 20,000 values.`
   Swift limits depth to 64 and input to 500 KB, but has no value-count limit.
   Fixed afterwards in BelloBox `de218fb`.
2. **Sort A→Z semantics.** Swift sorts with `localizedCaseInsensitiveCompare`
   (`alpha` before `Beta`); Rust sorts by bytes (`Beta` before `alpha`). The
   78× speed ratio therefore does not compare equal work. Fixed afterwards in
   BelloBox `2f475c5` (macOS sorts through Foundation's
   `localizedCaseInsensitiveCompare`; Trim and Remove Empty use Swift's
   whitespace set); the sort timing above predates that change.

### Box JSON Tools (end-to-end, external measurement)

Shipped Swift Box 0.0.77 (Keychain IPC denied, preferences backed up and restored
exactly) and Rust `d3fd43a` (release), one app at a time on a fresh launch, the
JSON Tools window in Pretty mode. Each sample clicks Clear, then Paste with the
input on the clipboard, and records when the footer reaches its finished state
("Copy Result" enabled), matched against a capture of that state
(`harness/box-json-e2e.sh`, `harness/belloperf.swift input --done-ref`). Both
apps wait 220 ms after an input change before computing (`UtilityWorkbenchModel.schedule`,
`json_session.rs`), so that is the floor. Inputs are the engine benchmark's
296 KB document and two prefixes of it (`harness/slice-json.py`, `box-e2e/inputs.sha256`).

| Input | Swift 0.0.77 p50 [min–max] | Rust `d3fd43a` p50 [min–max] |
|---|---|---|
| 30 KB, 115 objects (n=10) | 2,264 ms [2,227–2,367] | 256 ms [239–270] |
| 100 KB, 379 objects (n=10) | 24,571 ms [24,299–24,871] | 259 ms [251–278] |
| 296 KB, 1,100 objects (Swift n=2, Rust n=10) | 88,869 / 88,959 ms; the result area then stays blank | 260 ms [247–280] |

Swift computes off the main thread in ~50 ms (the engine benchmark above); the
time goes into showing the result, one SwiftUI `Text` with `.fixedSize` and text
selection in a `ScrollView` (`UtilityWorkbenchView.swift`, `e43b1c4`, lines
227–229). The main thread stays at 100% for the whole wait, and the cost grows
faster than the text (3.3× the input, 11× the time). At 296 KB the 24,201-line
result never draws, likely because the text layer is far taller than the GPU's
texture limit; at 30 and 100 KB it draws visibly blurred (`box-e2e/screens/`).
Rust shows results in its virtualized editor and is debounce-bound at every
size. This is a defect in the shipping Swift app, independent of the migration.

### Agent interaction and streaming (end-to-end, external measurement)

Same Mac, same loopback gateway (`harness/benchgw.py`: one 96,000-character
Markdown reply as 32-character `output_text.delta` events every 20 ms, 60 s),
same 400-turn / 800-message / 2.1 MB conversation (`harness/longchat_fixture.py`).
Swift is 0.1.122 (`6319e368`) built Release with testability and hosted by
`harness/swift-bench-host/SwiftRustBenchHost.swift`: the production
`WorkspaceRootView` and `ApplicationMenus` over an in-memory vault (the owner's
Keychain is never touched). Rust is the `973e7bed` release binary with the CLI
profile and a fake key; its session is seeded by `harness/rust-seeder`. Latency
= synthetic event post → first change of that window region in the window
server (`belloperf input`); its floor is one capture (~5 ms for the composer,
~8 ms for the transcript). Input was posted only while the app was frontmost.

| Measure | Swift 0.1.122 | Rust `973e7bed` |
|---|---|---|
| Typing in the composer, idle (n=40) p50 / p90 / max | 5.9 / 11.8 / 31 ms (at the capture floor) | 40.5 / 43.0 / 45 ms |
| Typing while a reply streams (n=40) p50 / p90 / max | 13.3 / 21.9 / 50 ms | 41.1 / 60.0 / 72 ms |
| Transcript wheel scroll (n=40) p50 / p90 / max | 21.0 / 31.0 / 51 ms | 39.3 / 45.1 / 50 ms |
| Find: first keystroke of a query whose only match is turn 200 → revealed (n=1) | 528 ms (150 ms debounce, paged from disk) | 260 ms (session in memory) |
| CPU while streaming, one core, p50 / p90 | 37.9 / 41.1% flat (reply on screen) | 28.8 / 51.6% with the reply off screen, climbing 10%→55%; 45.1 / 98.7% with the reply kept on screen, climbing 10%→100% |
| Footprint while streaming, start → peak | 90 → 132 MB (app + helper) | 83 → 107 MB (off screen); 82 → 120 MB (on screen) |

Rust's streaming cost grows with the reply's length. A mid-stream `sample`
(`interaction/rust-visible/sample-top-of-stack.txt`) attributes it to:

1. GPUI `WindowTextSystem::shape_text` ← `TextLayout::layout`: the streaming
   reply is one text element, so every frame re-shapes the whole growing reply
   (`memmove`/`madvise` dominate), i.e. O(reply length) per frame.
2. `bello_agent_core::stream_journal::append` ← `SessionStore::append_delta`:
   every delta is synchronized to stable storage (`fcntl`) before publication,
   ~50 times per second. Swift writes run records unsynced and synchronizes when
   the turn settles (`SessionJournal.append(flush:)`, `journalFlushesEachRecord`).

Behavior observed while measuring (screens in `interaction/screens/`): the Rust
transcript shows Markdown as raw text; it opens a chat at the top of its loaded
100-message window and does not follow a streaming reply (it is created with
`ListAlignment::Top` and preserves the reader's anchor). Swift opens this idle
chat at the question of its last turn, which is taller than the window (with a
Back to bottom button), renders Markdown with syntax-highlighted code and follows
the reply. The Agent's transcript placement was fixed afterwards; its copy of
this record (BelloAgent `rust` branch) holds the follow-up native check.

## Limitations

- The Mac is a virtual machine (paravirtualized GPU, 60 Hz virtual display).
- Launch times use direct `exec`, excluding LaunchServices/Gatekeeper. Rust apps
  are unsigned bare executables; Swift apps run from signed bundles.
- Launch screens differ in content (Swift Agent workspace without a selected
  chat vs Rust Agent disconnected empty project; both Boxes show Home).
- Swift Box runs with Keychain IPC denied (its synchronous launch-time Keychain
  read otherwise blocks on a password prompt on this Mac).
- Agent interaction results are single sessions per app (n=40 per latency
  series, n=1 for Find and each streaming run); Swift ran as an XCTest-hosted
  Release build, not the shipped bundle.
- Box end-to-end covers JSON Tools only; Text Tools, the image editor and Box
  typing latency are not yet measured, and movie-to-GIF cannot be compared
  because Rust's movie reader is closed. The 296 KB Swift case has n=2 (each
  sample takes ~89 s).

## Reproduce

Release builds as in METHOD.md; `harness/run-launch.sh` (owner approval needed
to launch the shipped Swift apps; it backs up and restores their preferences),
`harness/analyze-launch.py RUN`, `harness/idle-diagnose.sh`, and
`harness/microbench/run.sh` after extracting the two Swift sources from
`e43b1c4` (`git show e43b1c4:BelloBox/DeveloperTools/DeveloperJSON.swift`;
`TextTransforms.swift` lines 281–332 prefixed with `import Foundation`) and
generating inputs with the fixed-seed generator recorded in
`microbench/inputs.sha256`.
